<h1>Chapter 11: The Consultations</h1>
<p>
The EZLN Orders a Partial Deactivation
<br>of the Red Alert in its Territories
<p>[La Jornada, 4/22]
<br>April 20, 1994
<p>To the people of Mexico:
<br>To the people and governments of the world:
<br>To the national and international press:
<p>Brothers and Sisters:
<p>The Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee-General Command of
the Zapatista National Liberation Army addresses you to declare the following:
<p>First: The EZLN recognizes the honest and dedicated efforts by the Commissioner
for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas, Mr. Manuel Camacho Sol&iacute;s,
and of the mediator, Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garc&iacute;a, to create conditions
favorable for the continuation of the dialogue, whose objective is to achieve
a just and dignified peace. In the last few days, both the commissioner
and the mediator have worked on the solution of several obstacles that
oppose the peace process. The EZLN salutes this true willingness of these
two Mexicans.
<p>Second: The EZLN salutes the liberation of some civil prisoners, unjustly
accused of belonging to our troops, and sees in it a good signal for the
beginning of the continuation of the dialogue for a just and dignified
peace.
<p>Third: With respect to this, the CCRI-CG of the EZLN orders the partial
deactivation of the red alert in its territories and the return of part
of its troops to their communities and ejidos, beginning April 23, 1994.
<p>Fourth: If this climate, favorable to dialogue, is maintained, the EZLN
will restart the consultation with its bases, in a progressive manner,
starting with the least vulnerable territories, as soon as possible.
<p>Fifth: The EZLN reiterates its real desire for a political solution
to the just demands that animate its struggle, and it salutes the sincere
effort of civil society and Mexican personalities to find dignified solutions
to the large national problems through reason, and not through force.
<p>Holding high the popular demands of freedom, justice and democracy for
all Mexicans.
<p>Freedom!
<p>Justice!
<p>Democracy!
<p>Respectfully,
<p>Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee-
<br>General Command of the Zapatista National Liberation Army.
<br>General Headquarters, The mountains of the Mexican Southeast, Chiapas
<br>Mexico, April, 1994
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We are Surrounded
<p>[La Jornada, 4/22]
<br>April 21, 1994
<p>To the national news weekly Proceso:
<br>To the national newspaper La Jornada:
<br>To the national newspaper El Financiero:
<br>To the local newspaper of San Crist&oacute;bal de las Casas Tiempo:
<br>To the national and international press:
<p>Gentlemen:
<p>We hereby communicate to you about those freed, about red alerts, and
about consultations.
<p>We are touched by the stupidity of those who declare, with solemnity
and without reservation, that we are purposefully delaying the re-
<br>initiation of the dialogue. They say we are looking for pretexts and
trying to extend the solution to the conflict. To reach a solution, perhaps
we should greet with complacence the assassination of our compan~ero in
the "peaceful" lands of Altamirano; perhaps we are pleased by the arbitrary
detentions of civilians carried out by the military troops in Ocosingo?
Maybe it is the federal troops and the government, and not us, who are
surrounded; perhaps we enjoy not having food or medicine, nor any way of
acquiring tham; perhaps we are enthused by the inexorable asphyxiation
of the civilian population of our territory (to whom the supreme government
impedes the arrival of humanitarian aid; the federal troops, unhappy with
their duties, argue that the food is not for the civilians, but is meant
only to "fatten the little Marcoses"); perhaps our doubt about the supposed
exit of governmental troops from the area is without foundation; perhaps
the nighttime airplane is ours (the Zapatista Air Force?) and is only watching
to see that nothing happens to us?
<p>I am sorry to inform you, brilliant analysts, that we are surrounded.
However, in order to not contradict you, we have resolved to follow in
the footsteps of "the lords of the Central American guerrilla" and follow
the example of a "foreigner," "transgressor of the law," and a "professional
in violence" from the days of yore called Jose' Mar&iacute;a Morelos y
Pav&oacute;n. About this man and his troops, the "legal" General Fe'lix
Mar&iacute;a Calleja del Rey wrote:
<p>"If the constancy and activity of the defenders of Cuautla had morality,
and were led by a just cause, they would deserve a distinguished place
in our history some day. Stretched by our troops and afflicted by necessity,
they express happiness in all of the events. They bury their cadavers with
peals of celebration in their glorious death, and they celebrate with clamor,
dances, and drunkenness the return from their frequent trips, whatever
the particular success happens to be, imposing pain or death on anyone
who speaks of disgraces or surrender..." (recited in the book Siglo de
Caudillos: Biograf&iacute;a pol&iacute;tica de Me'xico (1810-1910) [A Century
of Caudillos: A Political Biography of Mexico (1810-
<br>1910)]. Tusquets Editorial. February, 1994.) The author is suspected
of being "an apologist for violence," Enrique Krauze, who I read with the
same, and sane, critical spirit with which he sees us).
<p>In sum, we confirm that this is "the last Central American guerrilla
group," and we celebrate 100 days of military encirclement and 112 days
of war with a great dance to which, of course, you are not invited (rigorous-evening-gown-ski-mask-
<br>etiquette-we-reserve-the-right-to-limit-
<br>admission). There will be no dinner, and not because we are surrounded,
but because we are on diets. The Zapatista orchestra has plenty of guitars
with no strings, tambourines, harmonicas and one or two violins. Its repertoire
is one of "delicious foreignism," and includes the Marcha de Zacatecas
and the one that goes:
<p>"For a bit, two reales
<br>for a sergeant, a tost&oacute;n;
<br>for my general Morelos
<br>I give all of my heart."
<p>That is all. I promise to send the chronicle for the "Social" section.
All right.
<p>Health and history, remember it points towards the future.
<p>From the mountains of the Mexican Southeast
<p>Insurgent Subcommander Marcos
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>To the Workers of the Republic
<p>[La Jornada, 5/2]
<br>May 1, 1994
<p>To the people of Mexico:
<br>To the people and governments of the world:
<br>To the national and international press:
<p>Brothers and Sisters:
<p>The Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee-General Command of
the Zapatista National Liberation Army directs itself to you to declare
the following:
<p>Today, May 1, 1994, we celebrate one more day for the workers. All over
the world, rural and urban workers celebrate their rebellion against exploitation
and reaffirm their aspirations for a more just world. In Mexico this is
a day of struggle. Ever since the evil government, which now oppresses
us from the Z&oacute;calo in Mexico City, usurped the just demands of the
Flores Mag&oacute;n brothers, a chain now strangles the best of the Mexican
workers. False and corrupt leaders, some for more than nine decades, traffic
in the pain of the Mexican workers. They are the sustenance of the supreme
government that now offers our history and our soil for foreign money.
The struggle of the workers for organizational independence has revealed
the triple alliance between the evil government, the corrupt leaders, and
the powerful men of money.
<p>Businesses of evil wealth have a new etiquette. Another mask hides our
pain from our own eyes. A new name has been given to injustice, to slavery,
to the usurpation: neoliberalism.
<p>The workers that build this country bleed from three wounds. The powerful
bleed them with unjust salaries, humiliations, and threats. The heads of
the great central government unions bleed the workers with extortions,
beatings, and death. Those who sell the country bleed the workers with
the dispatches of usurpation, writing the laws that their treason dictates.
<p>The workers die three times in the factory for the history of the country.
They die of poverty because they are not paid fairly according to their
work. They die of humiliation because their words of rebellion are silenced
by the treachery of those who claim to represent them. They die of slavery
because the evil government ignores their will and their efforts.
<p>The Mexican workers struggle three times on land and on asphalt. They
struggle for justice so that there can be bread and truth in their houses
and on their tables. They struggle also to speak and walk freely and to
not bequeath shame to their children. They struggle for democracy because
it is their power to transform matter, and also their power to govern and
to govern themselves.
<p>The future has three lives that we all desire for the whole country.
The life of their own strength in their brothers and sisters in recognized
labor. The life of the workers and campesinos, hand in hand. The life of
their embrace that includes all of the people, so they can march together
again with a new, good direction.
<p>Faceless, the worker lives and dies three times. Without a clean face
because of the hunger that dirties it. Without a free face because of the
treachery that kills it. Without a true face because of a will usurped.
<p>They die three times, they struggle three times, they live three times.
Faceless, they walk three times, those who make the riches of the country
into something located, something measured, something changed.
<p>Brothers and sisters:
<p>From another history, the same and different, another faceless being
looks with hope on this day. From the mountains of the last corner of Mexico,
faceless hope, tender voice and fire walking alone greet the workers.
<p>Three times the false masks which rob us today must fall.
<p>Injustice at work and in pay must fall. The treachery that leaves us
speechless must fall. The government that usurps our will must fall.
<p>Justice! Freedom! Democracy! These are the three keys to the three chains.
Justice in the right to a dignified job and to be well paid. Freedom in
the right to organize ourselves with independence from the powerful and
their spokespeople. Democracy in the right to demand that the government
obey us in its mandate.
<p>This is what we, the smallest of these lands ask for. We want this:
three rights, three struggles, three suns. A tomorrow of a new Mexico.
<p>Mexican workers of the city and the country:
<p>Let your voice run together with ours. Let your shout sound strong and
hard on this soil. Accept this hand that your smallest brothers and sisters
offer you. Three forces should unite their paths: the force of the workers,
the force of the campesinos, the popular force. With these three forces
there will be nothing to detain us.
<p>Our blood is already losing itself in history. Let the brothers and
sisters of the machine not let their brothers and sisters of the country
die in vain. Let all of the people unite. Let the curse that divides not
come again to our skies.
<p>Receive our voice, which, although far away, says: "Greetings, workers
of the sea and of the land! The Zapatistas follow you in their struggles!
With you there will be a country and future for all some day! Without you,
night will continue to rule these lands!"
<p>Freedom!
<p>Justice!
<p>Democracy!

<p>Interview with the Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee
<p>[Transcribed from the original tape]
<p>May 11, 1994
<br>Interviewers: Eugenio Aguilera (Nightcrawlers Anarchist Black Cross),
Ana Laura Hern&aacute;ndez (Amor y Rabia/Mexico), Gustavo Rodr&iacute;guez
(Amor y Rabia/Mexico), Pablo Salazar Devereaux (Haitian Information Bureau)
<p>Q: You are members of the regional committee of the General Command?
<p>CC: The Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee. Yes.
<p>Q: The Tzetzal Committee?
<p>CC: Tzetzal? Yes.
<p>Q: What is your name? Or what name do you want to give?
<p>CC: Manuel
<p>Q: Manuel, what is your role in the Committee?
<p>M: What do we do in the Committee?
<p>Q: No, but, do you also have a military rank, are you a commander, or
is it simply civilian work that is carried out by the Committee?
<p>M: Yes, civilian work. The political and economic work.
<p>Q: What are you specifically responsible for, as part of the Clandestine
Committee?
<br>M: Well, seeing what goes on in the region. If there are any problems
within the towns, the communities.
<p>Q: What type of problems?
<p>M: Whatever type of problem that may arise. Then we go around as the
Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee to resolve these problems.
<p>Q: Are you also responsible for finances?
<p>M: Yes, to raise funds in the community, as well as throughout the zone.
<p>Q: How does that function? Do you charge taxes to the civilian population?
How does the raising of funds take place?
<p>M: Well, in the civilian population, no. Only, also from some farmers.
What's being done now is that there are some farmers, or ranchers, actually,
who come to talk to us, who want, for example, to take some livestock.
So we'll say: Yes, you can, if you leave some money. No, no it's not like
a tax so much as a collaboration with the EZLN.
<p>Q: And the farmers collaborate, or are there farmers who are against
the EZLN, who are in favor of the government and things like that?
<p>M: Up until now, no. They have always been...supporting as well.
<p>Q: They're not large landowners?
<p>M: No they're not large landowners. They are small.
<p>Q: And many of them are Tzetzales, Tzotziles...
<p>M: They also speak Tzetzal.
<p>Q: How long have you been in the EZLN?
<p>M: Ten years.
<p>Q: Have you always been in the Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous
Committee or did you first enter into the militias?
<p>M: Yes, first we entered into the militias.
<p>Q: Were you an insurgent?
<p>M: Me? No.
<p>Q: You were never in the...
<p>M: No. I'm in the militia.
<p>Q: You always worked in the communities?
<p>M: Yes, we've always done work here with these towns where you have
to look at whatever problems occur.
<p>Q: You are from here? You are from this ejido, this zone?
<p>M: No. I'm from another town.
<p>G: Far from here?
<p>M: Yes, about five hours from here to there.
<p>Q: I also wanted to ask you, the work that the Clandestine Committees
do in the regions, is there also, for example, security of the ejidos,
where there are problems like in the case of alcoholism, people that drink,
that don't respect the laws of the EZLN regarding alcohol, or when you
find that a man is beating his wife or their kids? Do you have to act in
these cases, do you have to intervene?
<p>M: Yes, that yes, here inside the EZLN we don't permit that compan~eros
go around getting drunk, and even if they're not members of the EZLN. We
don't permit alcoholism. Yes, that is prohibited throughout the zone.
<p>Q: And as I was saying in the case of a campesino who hits his wife?
What do you in this case? If there were such a case?
<p>M: Yes, depending, we go out as a Committee to see about these problems
among the people. Then the people decide what kind of problem it is, and
the nature of the problem. And if the people say so, we'll punish. Then
the people are the ones to decide. It's not just up to the Committee. We
talk as a Committee. As a Committee we go to see that this is OK. If they
can be punished in this way. There it remains.
<p>Q: What means do you use? Do you fine people?
<p>M: Yes, a fine. What's being done now is that if a compan~ero has a
drink we fine him 10,000 pesos. Or give him a job to do. Cutting wood or
other things. That's what's been done in the past.
<p>Q: We interviewed Major Benito, as well as asking others in charge.
They told us that in the Army there didn't exist laws against homosexuality
but that it was the Committees, due to tradition, that don't permit for
there to be homosexuals. How do you understand... As a Committee, why don't
you permit it? And if there are lesbians or gays, what methods do you take...how
do you...do you punish them? Can they be gay freely? Are they expelled
from the community for that? How do you manage this?
<br>[Another member of the CCRI answers the question: Joaqu&iacute;n]
<p>J: Well, if there's a compan~ero who, as you've asked about alcoholism,
also if someone gets drunk or begins to fight with his woman. Well, we...are
going to call to attention [to the fact] that a compan~ero is doing this.
To make it clear...or to make them understand that it can't be this way.
Because it shouldn't be that you will do whatever you want. Even if it's
not their wife but another compa. We have to make it so that they have
to obey, have to carry out an order that we give.
<p>We are going to criticize...conduct a self-
<br>criticism. This is what we are doing. Some, who have a very grave problem,
where you have to punish--well, the punishment is not very severe. Nothing
more than so that the people will see. Since we are the Zapatisa Army we
have to demonstrate our heart in the struggle, not fuck with compan~eros.
It's to call to attention--to tell someone how a certain job can get done,
that people shouldn't be getting drunk, better, there's time.... We are
trying to carry out collective work. That is what we are explaining to
the compan~eros. That they shouldn't be getting drunk...
<p>Q: Your name is...?
<p>J: Joaqu&iacute;n
<p>Q: How long have you been [in the CCRI]?
<p>J: It's been about 10 years now.
<p>Q: Well, the question I was asking, when you responded about alcoholism
and about how people are punished when someone mistreats their woman or
their children. But I had asked the compan~ero Manuel... I don't know if
you understand the question...homosexuals.... They were telling us that
the Army doesn't have any law against that. They respect it, but that the
ones who, in fact, don't permit it are the Committees. It is because of
the Indigenous tradition. In the communities there is no tradition of homosexuals;
that is of men who like men, who go with men and not with women. Or women
who go with women and not with men. Therefore since you are members of
the Committee, I want to ask you: In this case, if this exists, is there
punishment? How do you proceed? Is it prohibited?
<p>[They talk to each other in their native language.]
<p>J: Well, what you are asking about, well, the law...like ourselves who
work throughout the zone...this can be decided in the communities...if
they have their plan, they have their...an agreement, in each town. A compan~era
who wants to get married... has to decide to do so...and if she doesn't
want to we are not going to oblige her if she....
<p>Q: Yes but, the case that I was talking about was, if there is a compan~era
who is a lesbian or a compan~ero who is gay--who doesn't like women but
likes men or a woman who doesn't like men but likes women ...the Army explained
to us that they, for example, don't have any law against this. But, that
the Committees, depending on the region, have laws, or actually agreements,
that don't permit it. So, the case that I'm speaking of, for example, if
a man likes other men, if he goes with another man, if he has sexual relations
with another man, has sex with another man. Or a woman that doesn't like
men, but likes other women and has a relationship with a woman. Is this
punished? Are they expelled from the community? How do you proceed in this
sense?
<p>[More discussion in their native language.]
<p>Q: Do you not understand what I'm saying?
<p>M: Yes...this... We are not really familiar with that. Because here
in the region, throughout the zone, this almost does not exist. Therefore
we don't really know about this.
<p>Q: It almost doesn't exist?
<p>M: Better said, it doesn't exist. Maybe in other places, but, around
here we're not familiar with it.
<p>Q: Then you don't know what you would do...
<p>M: No, nothing more than as the compan~ero said, what happens to these
people is that... We see it depends on the man or woman. If a woman wants
a man, that is on her part, if the man also wants it....
<p>Q: Since it doesn't exist here...no law exists against it, because it
hasn't happened?
<br>M: No, it doesn't exist because it hasn't happened.
<p>Q: The work that Joaqu&iacute;n does, I imagine that it is similiar
to yours. To try to raise and collect funds, to try and economically help
the EZLN in their regions?
<p>M: Yes, yes.
<p>Q: Do you also dedicate yourselves to recruitment in the regions where
you work?
<p>J&amp;M: Yes, we also do that.
<p>Q: You recruit compan~eros and compan~eras in the towns?
<p>M: Yes, it's up to the towns. If they want to join our struggle. They
have to report that they want to visit our community. If we go to visit
it's because a compan~ero wants us to talk with the people. We are going
to meet with all the people--to call out all of the people to explain what
the struggle is about. Because there are compan~eros in other communities
who don't even know how the struggle began, and now the struggle has been
clarified. Or they are seeking out the Committees because they want to
speak to them. If he comes, we are going to reach an agreement with all
the compan~eros of the Committees. Not only is one Committee in charge,
but there has to be an agreement between all the compan~eros of the various
Committees. And all the compan~eros of the Committee say you have to go
to that town because we need you to fulfill your responsibilities, to get
to know those compan~eros, to discuss and see how the struggle is going
there. That is the work that we do.
<p>Q: For example, in towns that are not like these villages and towns
here in the liberated territories--towns like Ochuc? For example...where
there are a lot of people who don't understand the struggle...who are on
the side of the Federal Army. Are there compan~eros there as well who do
work as Clandestine Committees?
<p>M: Yes.
<p>Q: The only thing being that they have to be careful...
<p>M: Yes, they have to be more careful because it's not very close to
here. In various places there are compan~eros from the Clandestine Committees.
Then there are various areas where the Committees can't reach because you
can't reach there, you can't do it.
<p>Q: In San Crist&oacute;bal, for example, do you have Committees?
<p>M: Yes.
<p>Q: Because there are zones, especially colonies like Hormiga, that are
almost a majority Tzotzil, Tzeltal. Do you work within these communitites
in San Crist&oacute;bal?
<p>M: Possibly yes, I don't know in which places... But yes, it exists.
The same in Ocosingo, everywhere.
<p>Q: Are you working in other states outside of Chiapas as Committees?
<p>M&amp;J: [They speak to each other in their native tongue.] We can't
speak about that...for security reasons.
<p>Q: OK. Thank you; that's all that I have... I don't know if the other
compas have questions?
<p>Q: To follow up on the other interviews we did with the compan~eras
and compan~eros, they all told us about the equality that women have within
the Zapatista Army. But, we also discussed with them the fact that in the
communities this equality hasn't been completely arrived at yet. I imagine
that you want this equality to extend to the civilian population.
<p>M: Uh-huh.
<p>Q: What are the methods that you use so that the compan~eros accept
this equality for the compan~eras, the same that exists within the EZLN?
Has it been difficult, does it take a lot of work?
<p>M: Well, yes. Right now it's been more work, it has required more work.
There are compan~eros in the towns who need to have things explained more
about our struggle so that they will understand, so that they will begin
to understand that there needs to be equality. So as a committee we struggle
more so that they will understand more about the organization.
<p>Q: What is the position of the Clandestine Committees regarding abortion?
<p>M: I don't understand too well.
<p>Q: Is it prohibited by the CCRI that in the towns, is abortion permited...abortion
being when a compan~era in the town is pregnant but doesn't want to have
more children, but she wasn't taking care of herself [on the pill] and
she became pregnant. If she wants to end her pregnancy, if she doesn't
want to continue her pregnancy...is it permited or is it the same as in
federal territory, outside of Chiapas where abortion is not permitted?
<p>M: Yes, that depends on the conscience of the compan~era or the compan~ero.
If they come to an agreement and they want to cancel that, have an abortion,
that's that. In those times it depends on the compa..
<p>Q: But, it's a personal decision, you don't get involved in that?
<p>M: No, not us. There are no laws against it. No, we are not going to
give an order, we are explaining, educating... If someone wants to plan...but
it's a question of whether they want to, it's up to them.
<p>Q: You have to respect the decision of the woman.
<p>M: There it is. Yes, in this case, now, the compan~eros and compan~eras
are understanding the situation here with us--we were very fucked. So now
it's being limited, pregnacies among the woman in each town. There has
been a little advance regarding this. Some women have five or six children
and now as we've explained, it depends on the father, whether or not he
can sustain so many--well then, no more. But we also don't require it either.
<p>Q: The Revolutionary Women's Law says the woman has the right to choose.
<p>M: Right. She has to say, she has to choose.
<p>Q: Thank you compan~eros, it was very interesting.

<p>Interview with Subcommander Marcos
<p>[Transcribed from the original tape]
<p>Wednesday, May 11, 1994
<br>Somewhere in the Lacandona Jungle
<br>Interviewers: Eugenio Aguilera (Nightcrawlers Anarchist Black Cross),
Ana Laura Hern&aacute;ndez (Amor y Rabia/Mexico), Gustavo Rodr&iacute;guez
(Amor y Rabia/Mexico), Pablo Salazar Devereaux (Haitian Information Bureau)
<p>Q: Much has been written and said about the Zapatistas, but little is
concretely known about your ideology. There are many who are trying to
claim your struggle as their own. The Maoists say that you are Maoists,
the Trotskyists say that you are Trotskyists, and the list goes on...
<p>M: The anarchists say that we are anarchists...
<p>Q: No, we have never been able to say for sure [laughter]. We need proof.
However, you have insisted that you are Zapatistas. Even now we remember
the words of an EZLN Major who affirmed: "We are not Marxists, nor are
we guerrillas. We are Zapatistas and we are an army." Anti-
<br>authoritarianism is felt in each of your words and actions, in the
manner in which you are organized, in the structure of the Clandestine
Committees, in the collective participation [within the EZLN]. In Mexico,
the only precedents for your actions and attitudes go back precisely to
those whose names you constantly evoke: Zapata and Mag&oacute;n. Has Magonismo
permeated your ideology?
<p>M: This is a question?
<p>Q:&nbsp; [laughter]. No, a presentation.
<p>M: I thought it was a speech.
<p>Q: No, no, a presentation.
<p>M: Well then, I'm going to explain. The EZLN was born having as points
of reference the political-
<br>military organizations of the guerrilla movements in Latin America
during the '60s and '70s: That is to say, political-military structures
with the central aim of overthrowing a regime and the taking of power by
the people in general.
<p>When the first group of the EZLN arrived here, in the jungles of Chiapas,
it was a very small group with this political-military structure that I
am talking about. It began to adapt itself to the surroundings, to try
to survive--that is to say, to permeate the territory, to make it survivable.
But, above all, it began to forge in the combatant, in that initial group
of combatants, the physical and ideological strength needed for the guerrilla
process. I mean by this that the mountains served as a school for cadres,
inflexible and constant, day and night. But things were taking shape. In
this period there were no cameras, there were no recorders, there was no
press, nor were there military actions. The only thing that lets you stay
in the mountains and endure is hope, because there isn't any payment. I'm
not referring to monetary payment, of course there never was any of that,
but to some moral reward, to something that would serve as some sort of
assurance that it is all worth it.
<p>Ten years ago, we were clinging to the hope that everything that we
were learning, with much suffering and many problems, was going to have
results someday. In that period, there was a double learning process: the
learning process of the mestizos (the inhabitants of this area call everyone
who lives in the city "mestizo") and the process of the Indigenous peoples.
The process of the Indigenous people includes learning the very basics--to
speak Spanish, the history of Mexico, reading and writing, basic notions
of mathematics, geography, biology, chemistry--in all, everything that
we mestizos have as our basic culture. And we, for our part, had to learn
and understand not only the world view of the Indigenous peoples of this
zone, but also learn a series of physical aptitudes that are not innate
to the Indigenous peoples, but that they learn when they are small: to
handle a machete, to carry large loads over long distances, to reduce their
food intake to the minimum required--in this case corn and sugar.
<p>In this interplay, this exchange, this give and take, we both went to
the mountains changed. What I mean is that, for the Indigenous people,
the mountains are something sacred, something special, something magical,
and ultimately something terrible. No, the Indigenous peoples do not go
to the mountains. In fact, when we entered the mountains, many of them
feared that something would happen to them before they could accomplish
anything. The mountains are the place of the dead, of the gods, of good
gods and bad gods, and because of this there was nobody who had experienced,
not even on their part, life in the mountains. The Indigenous people were
only used to living in their villages, to going hunting, to searching for
land where they could plant. We should talk about this "romantic vision,"
if you understand me, of guerrilla war, with its references to grandiose
military actions: the taking of power and triumph, all of those things
that could be references to the triumphant guerrilla wars of that era,
the Cuban and Nicaraguan revolutions.
<p>This environment brings you back to reality and makes you understand
that all revolutions have a cost and only those who are willing to pay
it can carry out the revolution. To begin with, at that time you had to
be crazy or stupid to try to carry it out. I think that we were both stupid
and crazy. There was nothing that would tell us that we were fine and that
the venture was going to have a future or that it had a chance. There was
the fact that we had tried to bring about change--not necessarily revolutionary
change--by other methods and in different places. But all of our struggles,
our struggles in the university, campesino struggles, workers' struggles,
collided with the State, with Power. It is better to speak about Power,
because there are places in which the action of the State is not perfectly
definable as such, and it makes more sense to speak of Power--in this case,
the Power of a dominant class that spreads to other areas--
<br>culture for example. Then you arrive at the conclusion, intuitively
or scientifically, that another road is necessary, the road of armed struggle.
<p>We then confronted the common belief that an armed revolution was possible
in any country other than Mexico. That is to say, Mexico was considered
the country of solidarity, but never the country of the revolution. When
we proposed a revolution, we were considered heretics among the left. The
left said that revolution wasn't Mexico's role, that we were too close
to the United States, that the regime in Mexico resembled the European
model, and that because of this a "revolutionary" change was only possible
by electoral methods, by peaceful methods, or, in the most radical scenario,
by insurrectional methods. This means that the unarmed masses, with broad
mobilizations, would disrupt the economy and create a crisis in the State
apparatus, which would then fall and a new government would take power.
When we proposed a guerrilla war, an armed struggle, we broke with this
tradition, a tradition that was very strong during that time. With what
was happening in Nicaragua and what was beginning to happen in El Salvador,
well... Similar things had always been happening there, but they were becoming
more intense. The struggle in Guatemala was rejuvenating itself a second
time, a third, a fourth. I don't know. Eventually someone said, "And why
not here in Mexico?" Immediately, there was a sense of caution, of prudence,
as if to say, "Not here; here our role is to help those peoples that are
liberating themselves and only later, eventually, Mexico might aspire to
revolution." The fact that we broke with this idea implies that we also
broke with other theoretical schema.
<p>We were always confronted with the mountains. Let's say we survived
that first stage, that this first stage was, in effect, about two things:
surviving and beginning our political work. In this initial political work,
a connection began to take place between the proposals of the guerrilla
group, the initial group of the EZLN, and the communities. This means that
there are different expectations of the movement. On one hand, there were
those who hoped that armed action would bring about a revolution and a
change of power, in this case the fall of the governing party and the ascension
of another party, but that in the end it would be the people who took power.
On the other hand, there were the more immediate expectations of the Indigenous
people here. For them, the necessity of armed struggle was more as a form
of defense against groups of very violent, aggressive, and powerful ranchers.
In addition, there was an approaching storm--no, let's not say approaching
storm--as if there was a wall, a wall that was the same mountain that separated
the jungle from the city and that separated the Indigenous peoples from
political power.
<p>It was this wall that permitted the EZLN to grow so scandalously without
anyone realizing to what point it had grown. The Indigenous peoples realized
the necessity of learning to defend themselves. They had weapons, but they
used them only for hunting or to protect their homes from animals or thieves.
Then, we found each other and we began to speak in two different languages,
but in this common point of necessity of armed struggle a relationship
began to develop. They needed military instruction, and we needed the support
of a social base. And we thus tried to convince them of the necessity of
a broader political project. That didn't occur until elements of the community
entered the Army. In that moment the difference between combatant force
and civilian force began to disappear, until it reached the point you see
now, when whole communities are Zapatistas, when there is no line that
separates the civilians from the Zapatistas.
<p>Then, when this began to occur, there began a confrontation, a relationship
of convenience, between two ways of making decisions. On one hand, there
was the initial proposal of the EZLN: a completely undemocratic and authoritarian
proposal, as undemocratic and authoritarian as an army can be, since an
army is the most authoritarian thing in this world, and also the most absurd
in that one single person can decide the life and death of his subordinates.
On the other hand there was the Indigenous tradition that before the Conquest
was a way of life, and that after the Conquest became their only way of
surviving. In other words, the communities, isolated, cornered, saw themselves
as obligated to defend themselves collectively, to live collectively, to
govern themselves collectively.
<p>Since the internal life of the communities was totally separated from
national and local political forces, the important thing was the work done
by the communities, and because of this, a collective government came about.
No, it was always there: a way of making decisions in common about problems
that affect the entire community. These decisions included decisions about
work that had to be done in common, judicial problems at an internal level--because
it isn't possible to appeal to the judicial power of the State. What I
mean to say is that the isolation of the Indigenous communities provoked
the development of another type of "state," a state to deal with the survival
of the collective, of a democratic collective with these two characteristics:
The leadership is collective and it is removable.
<p>In any moment, if you hold a position in the community (first, the community
has to have appointed you, independent of your political affiliation),
the community can remove you. There isn't a fixed term that you have to
complete. The moment that the community begins to see that you are failing
in your duties, that you are having problems, they sit you down in front
of the community and they begin to tell you what you have done wrong. You
defend yourself and, finally, the community, the collective, the majority
decides what they are going to do with you. Eventually, you will have to
leave your position and another will take up your responsibilities.
<p>So, on one hand, there is this form of organization. I'm going to make
a reference so that you understand better--student assemblies. Student
assemblies are better as forms of protest or for analyzing problems. In
the case of the Indigenous communities, it is a way of life. On the other
hand, we have the authoritarian form of the Army, of a political-military
organization, but a military organization above all. One began to see a
confrontation between these modes of decision-making until people from
the communities began to join the EZLN and the Indigenous form of decision-making
began to take precedence.
<p>I want you to understand me; we didn't arrive and say, "It is necessary
that the collective and democracy guide us." That isn't true, of course.
This wasn't our conception. Our conception was vertical: "What is necessary
is a group of strong men and women, with ideological and physical strength,
with the resistance to carry out this task." Our conception was that we
were few but of high quality. Well, I'm not saying that we were of that
high quality, but we sure were few.
<p>Finally, I can't say exactly when--it's not something that's planned--the
moment arrived in which the EZLN had to consult the communities in order
to make a decision. At first, we only asked if what we were doing was going
to cause problems for the compan~eros. And later, when we left the jungle
and entered the mountains, we also entered the assemblies and discussions
of the communities. A moment arrives in which you can't do anything without
the approval of the people with whom you work. It was something understood
by both parties: They understood that we wouldn't do anything without consulting
them, and we understood that if we did anything without consulting them,
we would lose them. And this flow, this increase of men and women who left
the communities in order to enter the mountains, made us realize that we
couldn't draw a solid line between combatant forces and civilian forces.
Even geographically this line had broken down. There were military units
that didn't live in the mountains but that instead lived in the communities
and participated in communal labors. They gave military instruction, but
they also participated in the work of the communities. When we reflect
on this now it isn't a question of "us" and "them"--now "we" are the entire
community. It was necessary to organize, to establish this collective authority
alongside the absurdity of a vertical, authoritarian structure. Then it
was possible to divide the process of making decisions. I mean by this
that strategic decisions, important decisions, have to be made democratically,
from below, not from above. If there is going to be an action or series
of actions that are going to implicate the entire organization, the authority
has to come from below. In this sense, even the Clandestine Revolutionary
Indigenous Committee isn't able to make every decision. You could say that
the EZLN is different because in most political-military organizations
there is only one commander, and in the EZLN the Clandestine Committees
are composed of 80 people, 100 people, 120 people or however many. But
this is not the difference. The difference is that even the Clandestine
Committees cannot make certain decisions, the most important decisions.
They are limited to such a degree that the Clandestine Committees cannot
decide which path the organization is going to follow until every compan~ero
is consulted. In the EZLN a decision cannot be made until everyone is consulted,
even if it appears that the majority of the compan~eros have already decided
for one of the options. Only after consulting everyone can the Committee
say, "We have asked everyone, and this is the result." The Committee cannot
say, "We consulted the majority and..." This could cost you your life.
You can't play games here.
<p>In this way, we were not a guerrilla group, but an army, an army with
territory, with troops, with a general strategic plan. Our initial plan
was a defensive plan, a plan in which the compan~eros could participate
in one of three different ways: as part of the regular combat force that
lives in the mountains, as part of the irregular combat force that lives
and works in the communities, or as part of a reserve force composed of
the elderly and children. These last also receive military training. At
last, we arrived at the point where we were able to mobilize 5,000 people
and concentrate them in a village as part of a military exercise.
<p>What was it that made this possible? A centralized command? No! Rather,
it was that decisions of this kind were made by consensus or consultation.
It is more than consultation; it is not a consultation to see what you
think, but more to ask, "What do you want to happen?" The purpose of this
is to give power to those who should have power.
<p>Then, in this interweaving, in this exchange between two different forms
of decision-making, the most orthodox proposals of Marxism or Leninism,
theoretical concepts or historical references--for example, that the vanguard
of the revolution is the proletariat, that the taking of state power and
the installation of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the aim of the
revolution--were confronted by an ideological tradition that is, how can
I say this, somewhat magical. It is magical in one sense, but very real
in another. What I mean by this is that it is an ideological tradition
born of war--in this case, the war of the Conquest that began, well, not
exactly five hundred years ago, and that continued through different historical
periods. It continues... It continues, and it grows. If we had been orthodox
leftists, we would never have worked with Indigenous peoples. Now, today,
I believe there are many theories in crisis. Who would have thought that
it would be the Indigenous peoples who would provoke all of this? Not even
in the Leninist conception of the weakest link was it thought that it might
be the Indigenous people, right? I told you that there was a learning process
at the beginning of our work here, albeit a forced one. It's not like we
said, "Well, we are going to learn and see what happens." No! We were closed-minded,
like any other orthodox leftist, like any other theoretician who believes
that he knows the truth.
<p>Q: Even in "pure" Marxism there is discrimination against Indigenous
people.
<p>M: Yes! Definitely. The events of this last January will bring changes
at the theoretical level as well. We arrived here and we were confronted
by this reality, the Indigenous reality, and it continues to control us.
Ultimately the theoretical confronted the practical, and something happened--the
result was the EZLN. Therefore our combatants are right when they say,
"We are not Marxist-Leninists, we are Zapatistas." They are referring to
this synthesis, this coming together, this compatibility that incorporates--I'm
going to be very schematic--the historical traditions of struggle and resistance
of Indigenous people and the necessity of a national revolution.
<p>Q: Excuse me for interrupting. This is exactly the meaning of the initial
question: whether you believe that Magonismo has permeated the Zapatista
movement. Let's look at the history of the Mexican revolution, in which
Mag&oacute;n, who was also a descendent of Indigenous people, of Indigenous
parents in Oaxaca, had a similar vision. He took into account the needs
of the Indigenous peoples and didn't limit himself to saying, "Those poor
Indians!" but also assumed the responsibility of analyzing how to create
an army with Indigenous bases, an army with a collective participation
in the command structures. This is the point of the first question: Do
you believe that Magonismo has permeated the ideological formation of the
EZLN?
<p>M: Look, I have to be honest. When we talk about Magonismo, it also
makes me think of the orthodox line, closed-minded and stupid. This is
the truth. The Mag&oacute;n brothers are only talked about in the context
of the labor movement, although we know that they developed many other
important projects as well. But, ultimately, the unintentional result is
that they are spoken of in this way. We referred to the Flores Mag&oacute;n
brothers in order to highlight the need for the workers to participate
in the revolution, and in order to highlight an important force that existed
during the time previous to the outbreak and spread of the armed struggle
in 1910-21.
<p>Ultimately, this synthesis or confrontation that I am speaking of occurred
in such a way that the EZLN was born without any links to the workers.
I think that perhaps the synthesis was not enough. Probably it could have
used more influence from Mag&oacute;n. It probably lacked more input from
the history of the Mexican workers' movement so as to be able to truly
incorporate the workers into the armed struggle. I'm not saying that we
didn't consider this on a theoretical level, but evidently in practice
nothing happened. This is to say that there was an error, not in the reality--I
can't say, "Reality is stupid because it doesn't suit what I am thinking."
It means that we were stupid because we didn't understand reality.
<p>Q: In this sense, the Zapatista movement and the Zapatista revolution
have been called the first post-modernist revolution. Now, let's analyze
the fact that many current theories of the new left, of an anti-authoritarian
left with a definite tendency toward libertarian communism, break with
the blueprint that sees the working class as the vanguard of the social
revolution. Many of these new theories even see the working class as a
class in decline, a class that does not recognize itself as a class, a
class that less and less wants to be considered the working class. Is this
conception of the working class one that you have adopted during your experiences?
<p>M: No, definitely not. Those idols against which we were fighting were
different. The idea that armed struggle was possible in all places except
Mexico was so omnipresent that we were obligated to confront it first and
leave the rest for later. Beyond this, in historical or theoretical terms,
who would have speculated before December 31, 1993 that it wasn't going
to be the proletariat leading the revolution? Then who? Who was it going
to be? They could have speculated that it would be the teachers, they could
have speculated that it would be the unemployed, they could have speculated
that it would be the students or some sector of the middle class, they
could have speculated that it would be leftist or democratic factions within
the Federal Army or within the supposedly democratic faction of the PRI.
They could have speculated many things, including that the United States
would become socialist and then they would invade us and make us socialists
[laughter]. This was the reasoning then. Even in the university this idea
had taken root.
<p>It didn't occur to anyone that the Indigenous peoples were going to
play this role and that they would manage to demand their place in the
nation, or that they would demand that the nation recognize that they have
a proposal, that they have a proposal for the nation. The same or better
or worse--it's open for discussion--as any other proposal that intellectuals
or political parties or social groups have for this country.
<p>Q: We don't want to deviate much from the questions that we planned
to ask you, but now that you have brought up the term "nation"... There
have been many discussions regarding this concept. Even within the discussions
of post-
<br>modernism the term "nation" continues to be marked by a petit-bourgeois
conception. The "nation" is used as an abstract feeling of a patriotism
that ultimately does nothing more than pit us against one another, country
against country. And in this sense, we have felt a certain distance, for
example, between points such as the autonomy of the Indigenous peoples
and the national proposals of which you speak. We would like it if you
could tell us a little of the vision of which you speak. When you refer
to your national proposals, is it with this bourgeois vision of the nation-state-fatherland,
or are you merely using a language a little, well, we could say, more common--something
more direct and easier to understand?
<p>M: When we speak of the nation we are necessarily speaking of history,
of a history of common struggle with historical references that make us
brothers to one group of people without distancing us from other groups.
But what more do we have in common with the history of what is today called
Mexico? I say this because the first accusation against Zapatismo is that
it is aligned with Central America. Therefore it has to delineate itself
and explain that its vision is not directed towards the South, but rather
towards the North. That is to say, to that historical tradition that has
brought it together with a group of people--in this case with the Mexican
people, not with the Central American peoples. Because... remember that
the other thing being said is that this revolution is the last Central
American revolution. Some say it is the first post-modern revolution, others
say that it is the last Central American revolution, even geographically
speaking.
<p>What occurs as a result of this insistence... When the concept of autonomy
is brought up, the state understands it in this way: "Well, what the Indigenous
peoples want are reservations, like the ones North American Indians have."
This is where the compan~eros say, "No, if we are going to end up like
the North American Indians on reservations, no." This is not the concept
of autonomy that we want, rather, that they recognize, for example, this
structure of government that I have explained, a structure that gives us
validity. We don't want them to operate as if they were conquering territory.
When the Federal Army entered the communities before the war, or the judicial
police or the Public Security police, or the municipal police, they entered
as an invading army in enemy territory, even physically. When an army invades
a country, everyone from that country is an enemy. When they entered the
communities, they entered acting as if everyone were an enemy. At that
point, the compan~eros said, "We have our own forms of government, we have
traditions of community decision-making that must be respected by the government.
And not only that--these traditions are a good example for the national
government, for the government of this country, for any government that
pretends to be a democracy."
<p>For this reason we speak of Mexico, of the Mexican nation, because we
must mark our boundaries, we must say, "It is not nostalgia for Central
America, it is not nostalgia for Nicaragua, nostalgia for El Salvador."
On the other hand, when they speak of autonomy they are speaking as sectarians.
They don't look to the future but to the past, the nostalgia... They look
to ethnicity in a pejorative sense, as if we wanted to create a bubble,
a bubble like the one in the movie, a bubble that isolates you from contamination
or from what happens outside it. Therefore, any concept that you put out
there... We must make clear what we are speaking of in all senses.
<p>Q: From our point of view... We felt a little shocked by the discrepancy
in your positions. For example, what is put forward as the "nation" of
Mexico we understand to be very similar to what Indigenous peoples understand
to be the "nation" of the United States. It is a large nation that dominates
a large number of Indigenous peoples, of small Indigenous nations. In this
case they may be Choles, Tzotziles, Triquis, Yaquis. The same thing happens
in the case of the United States. It is a large nation that has oppressed
a large number of small nations, such as the Yaquis, the Pomos, the Apaches,
the Dakotas, etc. And in this sense we understand Mexico to be an imperialist
nation that has kept all of these peoples oppressed without recognizing
their culture, their traditions, their identities, a nation that has imposed
a culture and an identity and that is trying to maintain the entire territory
under its control without the least respect for cultures, traditions, identities,
or anything of the kind. This then we see as a kind of contradiction, speaking
of a national project... Well, we can see it in history with the example
of L&aacute;zaro C&aacute;rdenas when he was in the Army. He went to war
against the Yaqui, no? And this was to massacre and oppress the Yaqui people,
a people who were in rebellion, and who had not allowed themselves to be
oppressed, a people who were one of the bastions of resistance against
the so-called "new nation." Therefore, we see a contradiction. I don't
know if you have given thought to this, if you have come across this contradiction
in your experiences.
<p>M: No, this is your position, but since this is my interview, I am going
to explain ours. Look, we believe that today's Mexico, the Mexico that
we are fighting against, is not a Mexico in the abstract but rather a project
of a certain class, of a certain social group. This project was born of
the disorder or of the internal agreement provoked by the revolution at
the beginning of this century. The implementation of this project has brought
about a series of things as you indicate: domination, questions of land,
of forms of government. For example, the lie that there is a federation
when in reality the states depend upon the central government, or the lie
that there are free townships when in reality the townships are dependent.
We believe that it is possible to have the same Mexico with a different
project, a project that recognizes not only that it is a multi-ethnic state--in
fact, multi-
<br>national--but also that new concepts are needed in order to reform
the Constitution. But, since there isn't a just relationship between the
Federation and its parts, we are proposing autonomy. We are proposing this
because we are mostly Indigenous people, but what we say with respect to
the need for autonomy could be applied equally to the townships, to the
unions, to social groupings, to campesino groups, to the governments of
the states or to the states that are nominally free and sovereign inside
the Federation.
<p>Q: Could it be said that you view the future society for which you are
fighting as one in which the free township, the autonomous township, will
be put into practice, a society in which a federation will be put into
practice based upon a citizens, confederation?
<p>M: No, before this we have to complete the other revolution. The EZLN...
The revolution that we are proposing isn't an Indigenous revolution. The
EZLN was born with Indigenous demands due to how it developed, but it aspires
to organize the workers, non-Indigenous campesinos, students, teachers,
and all of the other social sectors in order to carry out a broader revolution,
not just an Indigenous revolution.
<p>We don't believe that the result of this revolution that we are proposing
will be a new world, a new country; it will only be a first step, an antechamber
that you enter before you enter this new country. We are proposing a space,
an equilibrium between the different political forces, in order that each
position has the same opportunity to influence the political direction
of this country--not by backroom deals, corruption, or blackmail, but by
convincing the majority of the people that their position is best. I mean
by this... If there is a neoliberal proposal for the country, we shouldn't
try to eliminate it, but confront it. If there is a Trotskyist proposal,
a Maoist proposal, an anarchist proposal, or proposals from the Guevaristas,
the Castristas, the Existentialists or whatever "ists" that you may think
of, they shouldn't be eliminated. They shouldn't be discussed in the way
we are discussing them now, in small groups. In this discussion, we are
demonstrating that we know a lot, that we speak very prettily, but in the
discussions that we are proposing... The rest of the country shouldn't
be spectators, like they will be for the debate tomorrow [On May 12, for
the first time in Mexican history, the presidential candidates of the major
Mexican political parties engaged in an open, televised debate--trans.]The
people have to decide what proposal to accept, and it's the people whom
you have to convince that your opinion is correct. This will radically
change the concept of revolution, of who the revolutionary class is, of
what a revolutionary organization is. Now, the problem isn't in fighting
against the other proposals, but instead, in trying to convince the people.
It's because of this that the Zapatista revolution isn't proposing the
taking of power, it isn't proposing a homogeneous ideological concept of
revolution. We are saying that yes, we do have our idea of how the country
should be, but something is lacking before we talk about this. We cannot
replicate the same logic as the government. They have a vision for the
country that they have imposed on the people with the weapons of the Federal
Army. We cannot reverse this logic and say that now the Zapatista vision
is going to be imposed on the people with the weapons of the Zapatista
Army. We are saying, "Let's destroy this state, this state system. Let's
open up this space and confront the people with ideas, not with weapons."
This is why we propose democracy, freedom, and justice--justice in order
that certain material conditions are satisfied so that people have an opportunity
to participate in the political life of the country. We are saying, "We
don't want this new world yet. We are not talking about a new world yet.
We aren't talking about what form Article 27 should take. We aren't talking
about what form the Federation agreement should take. We aren't talking
about what form Indigenous autonomy should take. We are talking about a
democratic space where the political parties, or groups that aren't parties,
can air and discuss their social proposals."
<p>Q: Marcos, in analyzing the way in which you are organized--at least
what you have let us see--
<br>it's evident that when you speak of democracy, you are referring to
direct democracy, to total participation, to a participation in which each
and every person who makes up this country, everyone that is living at
this time in Mexico, can participate. Is this interpretation accurate?
<p>M: Yes. Definitely. Look, what we are trying to do... We are a clandestine
organization that has taken up arms against the government, and still we
are very careful to try and maintain this democracy. By this I mean the
direct vote, everyone's vote. Yes, because only the Zapatistas can vote.
It's not the kind of process where you arrive and ask the people, "Are
you for war or are you for peace? Well, I'm for war. And you? Peace." And
you go adding up the votes.
<p>No, I tell you that it must be the logical outcome of community discussion.
The people meet in assemblies and the representatives put forth, for example,
in the case of the consultations, the demands of the EZLN and the response
of the government. They're explained. What is it that we asked for and
what has the government said in response? And they begin to debate, "Well,
this is bad, and this is good." After the community says, "We have already
debated, we already understand, now we can vote,"--this could take days.
In fact, almost all the consultations have gone on for two, three days
now and they haven't yet reached the point of voting. They arrive and say,
"Well, okay, we are in agreement, let's vote if we are ready to vote, if
we already understand what it is we are going to decide." It's not about
raising your hand or putting a check-mark for one option or the other.
You have to debate and analyze the pros and the cons.
<p>In this case, you're not voting for a governor where he could turn out
to be a son of a bitch, you're voting for your life or death as an organization.
If you're at war you already know that you could live or die. But, if you
err in a decision and you vote for war when it is time for peace or you
vote for peace when it is time for war, you disappear as an organization.
You might disappear because they destroy you, because you lose prestige
or moral authority, or because you become a traitor to yourself by signing
a fictitious peace that nobody wants. You can't leave decisions of this
magnitude to a group of leaders, no matter how collective they are or how
large the group is. Not even the Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee
can decide these things. The Committee can't meet and decide, "We analyzed
what Camacho said and we are going to decide yes or no." They can't do
that.
<p>Q: Do you strive for consensus in the general assemblies?
<p>M: No, there is direct voting. It isn't the sort of voting where at
the end they say, "The majority of the people voted yes and therefore it's
yes for all the people." No, it has to be known how many said yes and how
many said no, because these yeses and nos are added up proportionally.
It's not the consensus of the government, for example, that says, "Well,
nobody said no [laughs] so we have consensus. Are you in agreement? Nobody
said they didn't agree so that means that you agree." No, it has to be
a direct vote.
<p>Q: We want to ask you another question that deals with ground that's
already been covered to some extent, since it's been made clear during
the interview that the EZLN has never considered itself to be the vanguard
of the Mexican revolutionary movement. Nevertheless, I need to ask this
question directly because other groups, specifically the Revolutionary
Worker's Clandestine Party-Union of the People [Partido Revolucionario
Obrero Clandestino-Uni&oacute;n del Pueblo, PROCUP], have said that they
are the vanguard of Zapatismo, that they, as a party, are the vanguard
of Zapatismo. PROCUP recently circulated a document in which they implied
that the EZLN is one of their "belligerent groups," and that all the recent
events in Mexico are part of PROCUP's national plan, of which, logically,
they are the vanguard. Is this true? Do you have some connection?
<p>M: The left is very closed-minded. The traditional left is very closed-minded.
They say, "Well, these people don't draw from any of the known ideologies,
so they must not have one. I will lend them one." [laughs]. Or they say,
"They are good people but they don't know what they want. I'm going to
tell them what they want." Or "They're good people but they need a leader.
I'll be their leader." This is the reality not just in the case of PROCUP,
but with groups of Trotskyists and Maoists who say, "What the EZLN needs
is... ME!" [laughs].
<p>Q: My leadership...
<p>M: Yes, ultimately, "my leadership." What upsets the Pentagon is that
when you punch "Zapatista" into the computer, nothing comes out that says,
"Moscow," or "Havana," or "Libya," "Tripoli," "Bosnia" or any other group.
And the left, accustomed to the same way of thinking, says, "Well, they
don't fit in anywhere." It doesn't occur to them there might be something
new, that you have to re-theorize. And they say, "Well then, these poor
people don't know what they want, we need to help them." And furthermore,
we are talking about an armed force at war, surrounded, that isn't able
to receive all the declarations or the newspapers. Eventually, we find
out what is said after a week or maybe 15 days. So, they know that we will
not be able to deny it. We can't stop it. But, we believe that... We have
confidence in the people, in the community, in that we have been clear
about our positions, and that people will have difficulty swallowing that
we are the armed arm of PROCUP or of any other organization of any type.
But I have seen various magazines...
<p>Q: Very insidious... the commentaries.
<p>M: ...of Trotskyists and Maoists, of all of the orthodox leftists and
of the old dinosaurs who say, "Well, the EZLN is very good and what they've
done is very good and all, but they lack a program, so here's a program.
They lack a party, so here's a party. They lack a leader, so here's a leader."
This attitude is held by everyone from Aguilar Talamantes to the left.
<p>Q: Yes, he already wanted you to be a candidate for president, right?
<p>M: No, first he wanted to be our candidate for the presidency. [laughs].
<p>Q: Later he wanted you to be the candidate.
<p>M: Yes, but he made it very difficult. First I had to prove that I was
more intelligent than he was.
<p>Q: Really? Imagine! Impossible.
<p>M: Evidently it was impossible.
<p>Q: Going back to the previous discussion, Dr. Armando Quiroz Alejandre
of the National Assembly for Human Rights [Asamblea Nacional de Derechos
Humanos, ANDH] met with comrades of the Zapatista Solidarity Committee
in New York City. During the visit, he insinuated in private discussions
with these comrades that PROCUP has a link to the EZLN and furthermore
that the EZLN is following the same political line as PROCUP.
<p>M: It's not true. Those people need to be publicly denounced. It can't
be. Why should the Zapatistas provide the dead bodies and the other groups
collect the dollars and fool people into thinking that they're providing
solidarity for an organization that never receives any of this aid? We
don't subscribe to their ideologies--in this case the ideology of PROCUP.
We definitely don't subscribe... If we subscribed to the ideology of PROCUP,
well, we would be PROCUP. We are not, we are not in any way in league with
them, we have not even entered in any kind of conversation with them since
our inception, since their inception. There is absolutely no type of alliance.
Well, in the sense that we are all human beings, you could also [laughs]
link us to Clinton or to Reagan, to Perot, to Che, to Zapata.
<p>Q: With anybody... Now that we are clearing some things up. There have
been other groups that have manipulated things in a different way. Specifically
in the case of CLETA, who said, for example, that you are their vanguard.
This is the opposite of PROCUP. CLETA needed a vanguard and put you in
that position. Furthermore, as we are talking about the problem of solidarity,
they are one of the groups that has organized concerts and collected funds
saying that they are for you, saying that it is for...that this aid reaches
you, that this money reaches you.
<p>M: Well, we're going to wait until it arrives. But, up until now nothing
has arrived [laughs].
<p>Q: Nothing has arrived. A number of very biased press sources have tried
to equate the EZLN with the Shining Path [Communist Party of Peru-Shining
Path, Partido Comunista de Peru-Sendero Luminoso]. Making a simply objective
analysis you can see that both groups are very different. For example,
while the Shining Path has committed innumerable executions, you [the EZLN]
tried a criminal like Absal&oacute;n and you put him to work in the corn
fields and in the end you freed him. We would like it if you could expound
on this because there are Maoists who say that you part of the international
Maoist revolution, that there is a link between the Shining Path and the
Zapatista Army, etc., etc.
<p>M: No, there is no link. Look, if the Mexicans couldn't accept that
an armed revolution was possible in Mexico, definitely foreigners couldn't
accept the possibility. Come on, everyone saw, or still sees, Mexico as
the rearguard for political solidarity work. Now I'm remembering something;
let's see if this relates to the question--it will make the tape recorder
jump. We just received a feminist magazine that says that we are sexists
because we chose war and war is sexist, armies are in and of themselves
sexist, so therefore the EZLN is sexist. Therefore, what the EZLN needs
is to be feminist. The article was brilliant--it moved me to tears. I don't
remember what it was called--it was written by "pure" feminists. The article
goes beyond anything I've seen.
<p>Q: La Fem?
<br>M: No.
<p>Q: Is it national?
<p>M: No, it appeared to be...
<p>Q: Well, on that note, I'm going skip around in the order of the questions.
<p>M: No, it's that the article says... the foreward says, "Only for Zapatista
women." And I disobeyed and read it, but I will pass it along to the compan~eras.
<p>Q: Well, one of the things that we are most concerned about--specifically
the compan~eras--
<br>are the gender politics within the EZLN. You facilitated our being
able to interview a number of compan~eras and we have seen--to the point
that you have allowed us to see [laughs]--that there exists an equality.
This can be seen clearly. The women say it themselves: "My partner,"--or
in the case of those who are married--"My husband washes his things, does
his work, does his part." And when you ask her if she has children, she
says, "Yes, I already have mine, my M-16." Things like this show that yes,
there is an equality that exists, at least in practice. The single compan~eras
that we've interviewed also tell us they do the same work as the men, that
they aren't limited to working as nurses or in the kitchen as a result
of being women. We would like you to tell us, as spokesperson of the EZLN:
What are the politics of the EZLN towards gender issues?
<p>M: Look, there are many problems. I am speaking for the compan~eras...
Above all in the civilian population, the civilians have continued practicing
many ancestral customs that don't belong in even a pre-revolutionary situation.
For example, many still believe that the man should choose the woman that
he wants to marry, but that the woman should have no choice in the matter.
The difference, including the physical difference, between the civilian
women and the combatant women is very clear. At the age when many of the
combatant women have, as you say, an M-16, many civilian women already
have four or five children, are beaten by their husbands; they don't know
how to read or write, they have no opportunity to develop themselves as
people. What the compan~eras say is that they cannot have their equality
decreed from above, they have to achieve it through struggle. They say,
"You can like it or not, but now we are going to change these things."
By force. That's why in our list of demands to the government, it doesn't
mention anything about gender. The compan~eras say, "We aren't going to
ask the government to give us freedom, nor are we going to ask you male
fools. We are going to ensure our freedom, our respect, and our dignity
as women and as human beings." I'm speaking of the compan~eras... They
also criticize us, the men, for our sexist or authoritarian attitudes.
For example, in relationships between combatants, many things have changed,
things that haven't changed in the civilian population. For example, in
the civilian population, when a woman marries, she is no longer allowed
to dance. She is married, and dances are places where single people meet
and decide to get married. If she is married, then she doesn't dance because
now she is somebody's "property." Among the civilians it is still this
way. Among the combatants, no, the combatants dance whether they are married
or single, and it is very common that the woman chooses her dancing partner.
They dance just to dance, to have fun, without any other motive such as
to sleep with someone or have a relationship.
<p>The politics of gender in the EZLN, among the regular forces... There
isn't a politic of gender, there are only combatants. There are women soldiers
and there are men soldiers, but in the end they are soldiers. In order
to rise to a command position, in order to rise in rank or to carry out
actions and missions, we take into account the soldier's aptitudes; it
doesn't matter whether they are male or female. Many times, in our daily
life as combatants, in couple relationships, sexist attitudes are reproduced,
and because of this our laws tend to favor the woman. It is very common
for couples to fight physically when they fight. Let's say that the difference
between the women combatants and civilian women is that the women combatants
hit back. [laughter]
<p>Q: They defend themselves.
<p>M: Yes, it's common that it's the man who comes to us complaining that
his partner hit him. We have to be very cautious in this respect because
both are armed; if it occurs to one of them to shoot the other... A blow
is much different than a gunshot. For us--for me it's very clear, and I
believe that it's clear to many compan~eras as well--that equality isn't
something that's conceded. You can't say, "I as a man am going to give
you your freedom and now we are going to be equal." That's not true, of
course. In the same way, the government can't concede us our rights as
Indigenous peoples; we have to fight for them. The women are also fighting
for them, many times in very radical ways. I believe that they've achieved
many things inside the combat forces and inside the civilian population.
For example, men who had never received orders from a woman, who couldn't
stand it when women would give them orders in the mountains... When they
saw them fighting, they saw that the compan~eras knew how to fight. They
look on them with respect now because they realized that the women knew
how to fight, and they didn't. They saw them facing death, and they stopped
being women. They stopped being women in the classic sense of the term,
weak and unable to...
<p>Q: Women in the pejorative sense.
<p>M: It could be also that you see a woman and you think that she's only
there to sleep with. But when it changes to, "She's going to give me orders
and I have to obey her," or, "I'm going to give her orders and she is going
to obey me," in that moment you stop being a female combatant or a male
combatant and you become a soldier, equal. I'm not saying that the women
stop being women and become men, but that both women and men stop being
what they are and become combatants. Since we are soldiers all the time--we
aren't able to take vacations--it is very difficult to tell when one is
acting in the role of combatant and when one is off-duty. I believe that
this has brought more benefits to the compan~eras than to the sexists,
to us men, in the sense that this equality in combat, in work is transmitted
to other aspects of life.
<p>Q: Do you accept the analysis that we live in a patriarchal society,
that men have controlled society for centuries, and that this is also part
of the system that feeds Capital, that feeds the bourgeoisie?
<p>M: Definitely!
<p>Q: We must rise above this and the sexist attitudes that we hold.
<p>M: Definitely! There are compan~eros who are very revolutionary politically,
but who are real assholes in relationships, in marriages, in relationships
between men and women. But, I believe that changes in this aren't going
to be our concession--I'm speaking as a man. The women are going to change
things whether we like it or not, despite our closed-mindedness. It is
the same thing we are doing with respect to the government. The government
doesn't like the fact that the Indigenous peoples have risen up, but we
did it. The sexists don't like the fact that the women are doing what they
are doing, but they are going to do it and that's that. They have fought
in combat, they haven't even won. Some of them led successful missions,
they won, they defeated men. They commanded entire units of men. The EZLN
is composed of about two-thirds men and one-third women. It is very common
to have military units where the only woman is the commander. The entire
unit, all of her subordinates, are men. This caused many problems before
January 1.
<p>Q: And these problems were eliminated?
<p>M: They finally saw that yes, what was important wasn't that they were
women but that they had learned during their years in the mountains to
lead the same as any man.
<p>Q: We have seen this. We have met many women captains during our stay
here in the liberated territories. We have met many female captains and
this demonstrates the truth of what you are saying...
<br>M: The male captains hide themselves [laughter]. No, that's not true.
<p>Q: Continuing along this same subject... We have seen that there is
also a cultural difference, a difference in tradition. You said this also,
at the beginning when you spoke of your links to the Indigenous communities.
Many of the compan~eras have told us that they aren't allowed to have sex
until they are married, that there is a regulation that says that they
must be married. If they like a man and they want to sleep with him, it's
easier to marry him. We're not speaking of a religious marriage, but that
you, the EZLN, expedite some form of marriage... But we feel this to be
a little puritanical, as if to say, "You can't have sex because you are
a woman and you have to be married."
<p>M: No, no, it's that marriage for us means that you are a couple and
you have permission. Let me explain. When you are going to have a sexual
relationship... During the day you can't have sex, you're working. The
most logical thing is that you are going to sleep with someone at night.
You have to advise the commander that you are going to be having sex somewhere,
because if you are attacked the commander has to look for you and... We
tell the combatants, "You have to trust the commanders to tell them that
you are sleeping with someone." Why? It doesn't matter to me, I'm not going
to watch you, I'm not a voyeur. It isn't like that. What I'm interested
in is that I have someone covering your position. If we are attacked, we
can't have the entire defensive line having sex. Well, it could happen,
but it shouldn't happen. We don't demand that they are married.
<p>Q: You mean a woman can have sexual relations freely?
<p>M: Yes, what she is told is to follow a birth-
<br>control method. That's why she is told to let us know, so that she
can follow a method. Because if you become pregnant... you can't stay in
the mountains pregnant, you have to go to town, go get an abortion there.
It has already happened; there are compan~eras who abort on the long walks
that... Then, the method has to be followed, you have to look after yourself.
Only when the Army says, "Now it's possible to have children and remain
in the mountains or at some positions," only then will it cease to be an
issue. But, yes, the nurses are asked to be checking for pregnancy. But
there is no formal procedure. You do have to ask the commanders for permission,
but it's not as if...
<p>Q: As if it's mandatory to be married to have sex, or anything like
that.
<p>M: No, no.
<p>Q: Simply put, it's more a matter of coordination, to...
<p>M: Yes, a military question. You let the commanders know, but generally
no, they don't get married to have sex.
<p>Q: They can have sexual relations freely?
<p>M: In fact, they have sex and then they say, "Well, not this one." Or
"Yes, this is the one I want to marry. Or maybe I don't want to marry this
person, but I just want it to be clear that we are a couple." They say
this to avoid gossip--
<br>like that he or she gets in bed with one person and then another, and
so on.
<p>Q: That involves culture and tradition as well.
<p>M: Yes, we are talking about Indigenous people that come from the villages...
<p>Q: Who hold different concepts than we who come from the cities.
<p>M: But it is a rule that you have to let the commanders know.
<p>Q: Now, when you were explaining this to us, something else came to
mind, another question. You spoke of the possibility... well, of pregnant
compan~eras who risk abortion while engaging in maneuvers. In the Women's
Revolutionary Law it is stated explicitly that a woman has full rights
over her body and her life. Radical feminists have been fighting throughout
the world to truly have control over their lives and bodies. However, the
issue becomes very confused when an article appears in the media, in a
paper like La Jornada, saying that the EZLN has presented a law proposal
to the governor of Chiapas in which abortion is addressed, but at no time
does it make clear in the media the position of the EZLN concerning the
issue. I don't know if it was intentional or if there really was no in-depth
knowledge about your position, but the media assumed that the EZLN is opposed
to abortion. Thus, I would like to divide the question in several parts.
The first question would be: What is the proposal of the Zapatistas in
relation to the legalization of abortion? And the second question is: At
this time, if a compan~era becomes pregnant because her contraceptive method
fails and she does not wish to carry the pregnancy to term, if she wants
to interrupt it, does she have authority over her body in order to decide
if she aborts or not? And the third question...
<p>M: Wait, wait, let's start with the first question.
<p>Q: Well, yes, let's go question by question. The first one is: What
does this law proposal consist of?
<p>M: The EZLN demands that the state's penal code be modified because
there is no political freedom. The government, taking advantage of the
fact that we are tied up in talks and that we are surrounded, is taking
the opportunity to reverse the decriminalization of abortion that existed
in the penal code. They say that this is at the EZLN's request, but the
EZLN did not request the modification of the Code in that respect. The
stupidity of this article is based on the argument that this is a position
of Samuel Ruiz Garci'a, that it is evidence of the influence of the Church
on the EZLN, and since the Church is against abortion they want it to be
penalized. Then, according to the argument, the Church directed us to present
this law proposal. We have not presented any law proposal or anything of
the kind--nor an electoral reform proposal or anything like that either.
The proposal says contextually: "We demand that the penal code of the state
be eliminated." We don't say that it should be reformed or replaced by
a more just one. We demand that it be removed because it leaves us no other
form of political participation other than taking up arms. That's what
it says. I sent a letter to La Jornada because of that stupid article that
was published.
<p>Q: Very insidious!
<p>M: Yes. That answers the first question. Question two: The compan~era
not only has the right to terminate the pregnancy, but the organization
also has the obligation to provide the means for her to do it with total
safety.
<p>Q: Well, that was the third question, you already answered it.
<p>M: If she says, "I have become pregnant"--it could even be that she
became pregnant on purpose, not just that the birth-control method failed--"but
I don't want it anymore," this is fine, as long as her life is not in danger;
I mean, if a certain number of months have gone by it can't be done. Then
she can demand by the right of Zapatista law that the EZLN give her the
means to terminate the pregnancy under the best health conditions that
the EZLN can ensure. It is the obligation of the commanders that she be
given these means. If the pregnancy can't be stopped, aborted, then the
commanders have to find the way to resolve the problem.
<p>Q: In this case, for free.
<p>M: It is not, in the strictest sense, control over their bodies, and
the compan~eras demonstrate this very clearly, "We are not free in this
sense because, for example, I can't become pregnant and continue to serve
in the Army. In this sense, I am not free. I am free in that, if I am pregnant,
I can stop the pregnancy, but if I am not pregnant, I can't decide to become
pregnant, because if I become pregnant, I have to leave the Army." And
yes, we do tell them they have to leave the Army, because of the conditions
we face. That's why the compan~eras say, "There is no freedom over my own
body." In the case of the female combatants, it is only half-freedom, the
other freedom is lacking. Right now they can't decide to carry a pregnancy
to term and remain in the Army. It is only fair to point this out, and
the compan~eras continue to fight for their right to become pregnant. The
other side of the issue has already been resolved for many years, and we
deal with abortions with the means we have at our disposal. Up to now,
no one has died during an abortion. In the communities, abortion is practiced
to the extent that our resources allow.
<p>Q: Then it exists also for the civilian population, for the women in
the civilian community. There is that possibility, in case she needs it,
if she so wishes.
<p>M: Yes. In general, they don't seek it because of their beliefs; also
for health reasons, since in their nutritional conditions an abortion can
be deadly. Sometimes it is best to let the pregnancy be carried through,
even if there is still time for an abortion. But we do facilitate the use
of contraceptives and all that, for example.
<p>Q: The compan~eras we met also had access to contraceptives. The question
has been raised of whether there is the possibility for the organization
of women's groups within the Army, where women could organize as women
of the Army, but also autonomously, as women. By this, we mean self-help
collectives, where they could gain and acquire more knowledge about their
bodies, and could even get to the point... for example, in the case of
abortions in the first weeks, there are methods that have been proposed
by radical women's groups, like abortion by menstrual extraction, one of
the first methods for aborting early in the pregnancy. Is autonomy given
in this sense or not?
<p>M: No, I didn't know about this method. The situation here is not so
advanced. The most we managed to achieve some time ago--when I was captain--many
years ago, was to have sex-
<br>education classes, explaining the man's body, the woman's body, what
was the mechanism of pregnancy, what things were going on in their bodies.
This was received with much enthusiasm from the men, and much embarrassment
from the women. The men came to see how a woman's body was. For example--look,
this town has a power plant project that breaks down all the time, but
when it works... Some months ago it worked for a few days. One of the compan~eros
told us, very enthusiastically, that at last he had "seen" his wife. He
said, "I finally saw all of her." And they have 10 kids. He had 10 kids
and he didn't know his wife's body. He didn't know his wife's body! Until
there was electric light, and they thought of making love with the light
on, then yes, he could see everything that was going on. And he talked
about it as if it had been his first time. He already had 10 children,
one of them fully grown, already an insurgent, an 18-
<br>year-old, a member of a combat unit.
<p>We organized these classes in order to combat the diseases that afflict
the women, so that they understand the necessity of hygiene. It is a problem
for them; the men don't take it into account. They think that when a compan~era
has a urinary-tract infection, from lack of cleanliness, for example--or
if she has her period--that she is just lazy, that she doesn't want to
work. We need to sensitize the men to this so that they understand that
a woman's body is not like a man's, in many senses. And that's why we organized
these classes. We try in the talks and lectures to address these issues.
<p>Q: Is there an education as far as the use of the condom--not only as
a contraceptive but also to avoid diseases, to avoid contracting and spreading
them?
<br>M: No, in reality, no. In reality, we teach about the condom as a contraceptive
when the compan~eras can't use the pill, when they get sick from the pill.
There are many who get ill from the pill, they are very young; when they
use pills with high estrogen content they get sick. With all the heavy
work they do already, they get nauseated, get headaches and all that--it's
very hard on them. They can't always get IUDs, the rhythm method is really
prehistoric, so then there is the use of condoms. But we should say that
the Zapatistas' sexual horizons are very limited. I mean by this that gonorrhea,
and things of this sort... Well, we didn't get a chance to catch them in
the cities, since we fled before attacking the whorehouses. We are in the
mountains, we are at war--within the regular troops, I'm saying, it is
very, very difficult to spread diseases. In fact, we have not seen one
case. And we can instill fear, in fact we did it, and they tell you, "Not
me, I have never been with a woman, where am I going to become infected,
or in what whorehouse am I going to catch this?" It's more pragmatic in
that sense. I am not saying it is good, because I do think that it would
be good to promote their use... but no, we haven't done it, I would lie
to you if I said that we were doing it. It is recommended when...as a contraceptive,
not for sexual hygiene.
<p>Q: Well, in case this kind of sexual education could be resumed... Do
you believe that it would be acceptable that the problem of disease, in
the case of AIDS, etc., be included in the instruction?
<p>M: I believe so. Let's say that we understand, for example, about AIDS.
Well, according to the information that we were getting when we were in
the mountains, AIDS is a homosexual's disease, and therefore, if you weren't
a homosexual, nothing would happen to you. In fact, we just found that
you can get AIDS in other ways, it can be transmitted even in heterosexual
relationships. I am talking about the basic sexual culture here, because
in this case all references to AIDS are in the context of homosexuality:
"If I'm not homosexual I have nothing to worry about." The main worry here
is different: "What I have to worry about is to not get anyone pregnant,
or that no one gets me pregnant." No, we don't have a sexual culture based
on fear of disease due to our isolation, but yes, we do need educate about
it.
<p>Q: Well, let's relate this to another question... We want to ask another
question relating to immediate solidarity. Have you received or do you
have access to condoms? Would it be feasible to bring them?
<p>M: Yes, but unfortunately they would be very hard to eat [laughs]. But
yes, we do get contraceptives, condoms and all that.
<p>Q: So, as I was saying...
<br>M: These things are allowed through by the Mexican Army so that the
Zapatistas don't reproduce [laughs]. They have enough problems with the
ones that already exist for us to make even more.
<p>Q: Now, relating the answers with other questions... One of the questions
that we were asked to ask by compan~eros Mateo and Robin is: what is the
EZLN's policy, in the Army and in the liberated communities, toward sexual
preference, in this specific case, homosexuality and lesbianism? Is the
EZLN given to the "satanization" of homosexuality that has sometimes been
found in other leftist groups? Or is it simply unknown what you are talking
about when you attempt to address these issues?
<p>M: No, let's say that at a level of, well, of basic culture, it is not
punished. I mean, they don't say, "He's a homosexual, put him in jail,
kill him." On one hand, they laugh, make jokes, but homosexuals have a
normal life in the community. Our position as an Army is that--let me put
it to you in a general way--there are many minorities that will have to
say, "Enough!" Just as the Indigenous people said, "Enough!" other minorities
not tolerated by the powerful will have to say it also. In that sense,
then, there is no sexual policy in the Zapatista Army.
<p>Q: That is, there is no law--in the communities either--that forbids
lesbianism or homosexuality?
<p>M: No.
<p>Q: Not even in the Army?
<p>M: No, not even in the Army.
<p>Q: There is no policy in the Army that says, "We found two girls fucking
or two guys fucking," and well... They are jailed, suspended, expelled--I
don't know...
<br>M: No, there is nothing like that. They go ask the commanders, the
same as when it is a male-
<br>female couple. That means, they let us know they are not going to be
at their posts, because that is what the commanders are concerned about,
that their position is covered.

<p>Communique' About the End of the Consultations
<p>[La Jornada]
<br>May 28, 1994
<br>To the national magazine Proceso:
<br>To the national newspaper La Jornada:
<br>To the national newspaper El Financiero:
<br>To the local newspaper Tiempo:
<p>Dear Gentlemen:
<p>This communique' is about the end, finally, of the consultations. In
addition, we have sent several letters to various addresses.
<p>We are totally surrounded. We have been "heroically" resisting the avalanche
of reactions to the event of May 15. Three days ago, helicopters joined
the airplanes that watch us from overhead. The cooks complain that there
won't be enough pots to cook all the food we will need if they all fall
at the same time. The superintendent argues that there is enough firewood
to have a barbecue, and that we should invite some Argentinian journalist
to it because the Argentinians know how to barbecue. I think about it,
but it's useless: The best Argentinians are guerrillas (for example, Che),
or poets (Juan Gelman, for example), or writers (for example, Borges),
or artists (Maradona, for example), or chroniclers (for example, Cort&aacute;zar).
There aren't any famous Argentinian barbecuers. Some ingenious person proposes
that we wait for the improbable hamburgers from the University Student
Council (Consejo Estudiantil Universitario, CEU). Yesterday we ate the
XEOCH's control console and two microphones. They had a rancid taste, like
something rotten. The medics are giving out lists of jokes instead of analgesics.
They say that laughter is also a cure. The other day I surprised Tacho
and Moi as they were crying...of laughter. "Why are you laughing?" I asked.
They couldn't answer because their laughter had left them short of breath.
A medic explained, "It is because they have bad headaches." Day 136 of
the military blockade. Sigh.
<p>To top it all off, Ton~ita asks me to tell a story. I tell her a story
as it was told to me by old Antonio, the father of the Antonio that appears
in "Chiapas: The Southeast in Two Winds, a Storm and a Prophecy":
<p>"In the time before the world came into being, the gods came together
and decided to create the world and to create men and women. They thought
to make the first people very beautiful and very strong. So they made the
first people of gold, and the gods were very content because these people
were strong and shining. Then the gods realized that the golden people
never moved; they never walked or worked because they were so heavy. So
the gods came together again in order to figure out a way to solve this
problem. They decided to make another group of people and they decided
to make this group of people of wood. The wooden people worked and walked
and the gods were again content. Then the gods realized that the golden
people were forcing the wooden people to work for them and carry things
for them. The gods realized that they had made a mistake, and in order
to remedy the mistake, they decided to make some people of corn, a good
people, a true people. Then the gods went to sleep and they left the corn
people to find a solution to the problem. The corn people spoke the true
tongue to find an agreement among themselves, and they went to the mountains
in order to find a path for people..."
<p>Old Antonio told me that the golden people were the rich, the white-skinned
ones, and the wooden people were the poor, the brown-skinned ones, who
forever work for the rich. They are both waiting for the arrival of the
corn people. The rich fear their arrival and the poor hope for it. I asked
old Antonio what color the skin of the corn people was, and he showed me
several types of corn with different colors. He told me that they were
of every sort of skin color, but that nobody knew exactly, because the
corn people don't have faces...
<p>Old Antonio has died. I met him 10 years ago in a community deep in
the jungle. He smoked like nobody else I knew, and when he was out of cigarettes
he would ask me for some tobacco and would make more cigarettes. He viewed
my pipe with curiosity, but the one time I tried to loan it to him he showed
me the cigarette in his hand, telling me without words that he preferred
his own method of smoking. Two years ago, in 1992, I was travelling through
the communities attending meetings to decide whether or not we should go
to war, and eventually I arrived at the village where old Antonio lived.
While the community was discussing whether or not to go to war, old Antonio
took me by the arm and led me to the river, about 100 meters from the center
of the village. It was May and the river was green. Old Antonio sat on
a tree trunk and didn't say anything. After a little while he spoke, "Do
you see? Everything is clear and calm. It appears that nothing will happen..."
"Hmmm," I answered, knowing that he wasn't asking me to answer yes or no.
Then he pointed out to me the top of the nearest mountain. The clouds lay
gray upon the summit, and the lightning was illuminating the diffuse blue
of the hills. It was a powerful storm, but it seemed so far away and inoffensive
that old Antonio made a cigarette and looked uselessly around for a lighter
that he knew he didn't have. I offered my lighter. "When everything is
calm here below, there is a storm in the mountains," he said after inhaling.
"The mountain streams run strongly and flow toward the riverbed. During
the rainy season this river becomes fierce, like a whip, like an earthquake.
Its power doesn't come from the rain that falls on its banks, but from
the mountain streams that flow down to feed it. By destroying, the river
reconstructs the land. Its waters will become corn, beans, and bread on
our tables here in the jungle.
<p>"Our struggle is the same," the older Antonio told me. "It was born
in the mountains, but its effects won't be seen until it arrives here below."
He responded to my question about whether he believed the time had come
for war by saying, "Now is the time for the river to change color..." Old
Antonio became quiet and supported himself on my shoulder. We returned
to the village slowly. He said to me, "You [the Army] are the mountain
streams and we are the river. You must descend now..." The silence continued
and we arrived at his shack as it was growing dark. The younger Antonio
returned with the official result of the meeting, an announcement that
read, more or less:
<p>"We, the men, women, and children of this village met in the community's
school in order to see if we believed in our hearts that it is time to
go to war for our freedom. We divided ourselves into three groups, one
of men, one of women, and one of children to discuss the matter. Later,
we came together again and it was seen that the majority believed that
it was time to go to war because Mexico is being sold to foreigners and
the people are always hungry. Twelve men, 23 women and eight children were
in favor of beginning the war and have signed this announcement."
<p>I left the village in the early morning hours. Old Antonio wasn't around;
he had already gone to the river.
<p>Two months ago I saw old Antonio again. He didn't say anything when
he saw me and I sat by his side and began to shuck corn with him. "The
river rose," he said to me after a bit. "Yes," I answered. I explained
to the younger Antonio what was happening with the consultations and I
gave him the documents that outlined our demands and the government's response.
We spoke of what had happened in Ocosingo during the offensive, and once
again I left the village in the early morning hours. Old Antonio was waiting
for me at a turn in the road. I stopped alongside him and lowered my backpack
to look for some tobacco to offer him. "Not now," he said to me as he pushed
away the bag of tobacco that I was offering him. He put his arm around
me and led me to the foot of a tree. "Do you remember what I told you about
the mountain streams and the river?" he asked me. "Yes," I responded, whispering
as he had when he had asked me the question. "There is something I didn't
tell you," he added, looking at his bare feet. I answered with silence.
"The streams..." He was stopped by a cough that wracked his entire body.
He took a breath and continued, "The streams, when they descend..." Once
again he was stopped by a cough and I went for a medic. Old Antonio turned
down the help of the compan~ero with the Red Cross. The medic looked at
me and I made a sign that he should leave. Old Antonio waited until the
medic left and then, in the penumbra of the dawn, he continued, "The streams...when
they descend...have no way of returning...except beneath the ground." He
embraced me rapidly and left. I stayed there watching as he walked away,
and as he disappeared in the distance, I lit my pipe and picked up my backpack.
As I mounted my horse I thought about what had just occurred. I don't know
why, it was very dark, but it seemed that old Antonio was crying.
<p>I just received a letter from the younger Antonio with his village's
response to the government's proposals. He also wrote me that old Antonio
had become very ill and that he had died that night. He didn't want anyone
to tell me that he was dying. The younger Antonio wrote me that when they
insisted that I be told, old Antonio said, "No, I have already told him
what I had to tell him. Leave him alone, he has much work to do."
<p>When I finished the story that old Antonio had told me, six-year-old
Ton~ita solemnly told me that yes, she loves me, but that from now on she
won't kiss me because "it itches." Rolando says that when Ton~ita has to
go to the medic's area, she asks if the Sup is there. If she is told that
I'm there she doesn't go. "Because the Sup only wants kisses and he itches,"
says the inevitable logic of a six year old, which, on this side of the
stream, we call "Ton~ita."
<p>The first rains have begun here. We thought that we would have to wait
for the arrival of the anti-riot water cannons in order to have water.
<p>Ana Mari'a says that the rain comes from the clouds that are fighting
on top of the mountains. They do it this way so that men and women will
not see their disputes. On the summits of the mountains, the clouds fight
their ferocious battles with what we call lightning. Armed with infinity,
the clouds fight for the privilege of dying and becoming rain to feed the
land. We Zapatistas are similar to the clouds, without faces, without names,
without any payment. Like the clouds we fight for the privilege of becoming
a seed for the land.
<p>All right. Health and a raincoat (for the rains and the riots),
<p>From the mountains of the Mexican Southeast,
<br>Subcommander Marcos
<br>May, 1994
<p>P.S.: The majority disguised as the untolerated minority. About all
of this whether Marcos is homosexual: Marcos is gay in San Francisco, a
black person in South Africa, Asian in Europe, a Chicano in San Isidro,
an anarchist in Spain, a Palestinian in Israel, an Indigenous person in
the streets of San Crist&oacute;bal, a gang-member in Neza, a rocker on
[University] campus, a Jew in Germany, an ombudsman in Department of Defense
(Secretaria de Defensa, Sedena), a feminist in a political party, a communist
in the post-Cold War period, a prisoner in Cintalapa, a pacifist in Bosnia,
a Mapuche in the Andes, a teacher in National Confederation of Educational
Workers (Confederaci&oacute;n Nacional de Trabajadores de Educaci&oacute;n,
CNTE), an artist without a gallery or a portfolio, a housewife in any neighborhood
in any city in any part of Mexico on a Saturday night, a guerrilla in Mexico
at the end of the twentieth century, a striker in the CTM, a sexist in
the feminist movement, a woman alone in a Metro station at 10 p.m., a retired
person standing around in the Z&oacute;calo, a campesino without land,
an underground editor, an unemployed worker, a doctor with no office, a
non-conformist student, a dissident against neoliberalism, a writer without
books or readers, and a Zapatista in the Mexican Southeast. In other words,
Marcos is a human being in this world. Marcos is every untolerated, oppressed,
exploited minority that is resisting and saying, "Enough!" He is every
minority who is now beginning to speak and every majority that must shut
up and listen. He is every untolerated group searching for a way to speak,
their way to speak. Everything that makes power and the good consciences
of those in power uncomfortable-this is Marcos.
<p>You're welcome, dear gentlemen of the Attorney General's Office, I'm
here to serve you...with lead.
<p>Postscript for the PRD-About the logic of the dead: The compan~eros
read what you wrote about "having had more casualties than the EZLN," and
immediately they started to count up the casualties. They added and multiplied
the casualties starting from more than 10 years ago when we began to lay
ambushes along the footpaths and roads "against bandits." The compan~eros
say that when it comes to counting the dead, nobody beats them. "We are
well trained in this," says Gabino. The discussions among the different
"tendencies" in the EZLN have become more heated: The most radical compan~eros
want to start counting from when the Spanish began their violent advance
toward the jungle and the mountains, but the more discreet and prudent
compan~eros want to start counting from when we formed the EZLN. Some ask
whether we should count those who have died during the 136 days that the
military has had us surrounded. They ask if we should count Amalia, 25
years old and with seven children. She began to become "a little ill" at
6 p.m. on day 125 of the military blockade. Then began the fever, the diarrhea,
the vomiting, and the bleeding between her legs, and at midnight we were
asked for an ambulance. The ambulance said that it couldn't make it, and
at 4 in the morning we managed to get some gasoline and we went to get
her in a three-ton truck. One hundred meters from the medical compound,
where Lieutenant Elena was, she said, "I'm going to die." And she did die,
98 meters from the medical compound and Lieutenant Elena, the life and
blood flowing out from between her legs. When I asked if she was dead,
Lieutenant Elena said yes, she died "at once." The morning of day 126 of
the military blockade, Amalia's second daughter looked upon the body of
her mother on the stretcher and told her father that she was going to ask
the neighbors for some stew, "because mother can't make it anymore." The
compan~eros ask if they should count Ibarra's daughter, who died "as if
she had become bored with coughing." Everyone is counting up the dead.
Some are using a calculator taken from the town hall in Ocosingo. They
are still doing this when Juana comes to ask them to count old Antonio,
"who died of sorrow." Later Lorenzo comes and asks them to count his son
Lorenzo, "who died during the night." By radio they transmit the names
of dead men and women. Soon people stop and take out their calculators
or pencils, and they look at each other. They're confused; they don't know
whether they're adding...or subtracting. Of pontificators. Magnificent
self-criticism is always opportunistic.
<p>Finally, you might accuse us of not taking into account the scale of
the different political forces, you might accuse us of political clumsiness,
of not having a satellite [dish] so that we could view the debate ourselves,
of not having subscriptions to the principal newspapers and magazines so
we could read the post-debate analysis. You might accuse us of not being
friendly, of being discourteous, of not recognizing possible allies, of
being sectarians.
<p>All right. Remember that all we have done is get hope started. We wish
you health and hope that you leave the animosity for the lazy fools.
<p>A hug from this side of of the military blockade,
<p>The impertinent subcommander, just like a tornado.
